SOME DUMP OF THOUGHTS:

There are 3 main steps in for a paper:

- Clustering

- Classification: Disqualify papers that have
  + no evaluation
  + no related work
  + not in English
  + clearly nothing new here
  + surveys are out too…

- Competition: Do pair competing between papers. Give points per topic: (-1 or +1)
  + Contribution: Most important novel contribution
  + Evaluation (explanation, more insightful…)
  + Understandable: Easier to understand? (Grammar, typos, inconsistencies…)
