## disqualified

filter.py — Filter and Classify Papers by Review Criteria

This script processes a papers.yaml file and classifies each paper based on predefined review criteria (evaluation, related work, novelty, etc.). It outputs the results into three categorized YAML files.

•	papers.yaml: A YAML file generated by marker_runner.py, containing parsed paper metadata and content.

```
uv run .\disqualified\merge_filter.py papers.yaml
```
The output YAML files, disqualified_papers.yaml and qualified_papers.yaml, should include only the following fields for each paper:

	•	id: the unique identifier of the paper
 
	•	title: the title of the paper
 
	•	decisions: a dictionary containing the evaluation decisions for each prompt

All other fields such as abstract, full text, keywords, etc., should be excluded from the output.
