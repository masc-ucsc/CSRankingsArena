- abstract: The graph neural network-based collaborative filtering (CF) models user-item
    interactions as a bipartite graph and performs iterative aggregation to enhance
    performance. Unfortunately, the aggregation process may amplify the popularity
    bias, which impedes user engagement with niche (unpopular) items. While some efforts
    have studied the popularity bias in CF, they often focus on modifying loss functions,
    which can not fully address the popularity bias in GNN-based CF models. This is
    because the debiasing loss can be falsely backpropagated to non-target nodes during
    the backward pass of the aggregation.

- abstract: 'User interaction data is an important source of supervision in counterfactual
    learning to rank (CLTR). Such data suffers from presentation bias. Much work in
    unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) focuses on position bias, i.e., items at higher
    ranks are more likely to be examined and clicked. Inter-item dependencies also
    influence examination probabilities, with outlier items in a ranking as an important
    example. They are defined as items that observably deviate from the rest and therefore
    stand out in the ranking. In this paper, we identify and introduce the bias brought
    about by outlier items: users tend to click more on outlier items and their close
    neighbors.'

  title: On the Impact of Outlier Bias on User Clicks
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591745
- abstract: The issue of fairness in recommendation systems has recently become a
    matter of growing concern for both the academic and industrial sectors due to
    the potential for bias in machine learning models. One such bias is that of feedback
    loops, where the collection of data from an unfair online system hinders the accurate
    evaluation of the relevance scores between users and items. Given that recommendation
    systems often recommend popular content and vendors, the underlying relevance
    scores between users and items may not be accurately represented in the training
    data. Hence, this creates a feedback loop in which the user is not longer recommended
    based on their true relevance score but instead based on biased training data.
    To address this problem of feedback loops, we propose a two-stage representation
    learning framework, B-FAIR, aimed at rectifying the unfairness caused by biased
    historical data in recommendation systems. The framework disentangles the context
    data into sensitive and non-sensitive components using a variational autoencoder
    and then applies a novel Balanced Fairness Objective (BFO) to remove bias in the
    observational data when training a recommendation model. The efficacy of B-FAIR
    is demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
    showing improved performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.

  title: Rectifying Unfairness in Recommendation Feedback Loop
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591754
- abstract: Most of the existing personalized recommendation methods predict the probability
    that one user might interact with the next item by matching their representations
    in the latent space. However, as a cognitive task, it is essential for an impressive
    recommender system to acquire the cognitive capacity rather than to decide the
    users' next steps by learning the pattern from the historical interactions through
    matching-based objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to model the recommendation
    as a logical reasoning task which is more in line with an intelligent recommender
    system. Different from the prior works, we embed each query as a box rather than
    a single point in the vector space, which is able to model sets of users or items
    enclosed and logical operators (e.g., intersection) over boxes in a more natural
    manner. Although modeling the logical query with box embedding significantly improves
    the previous work of reasoning-based recommendation, there still exist two intractable
    issues including aggregation of box embeddings and training stalemate in critical
    point of boxes. To tackle these two limitations, we propose a Contrastive Box
    learning framework for Collaborative Reasoning (CBox4CR). Specifically, CBox4CR
    combines a smoothed box volume-based contrastive learning objective with the logical
    reasoning objective to learn the distinctive box representations for the user's
    preference and the logical query based on the historical interaction sequence.
    Extensive experiments conducted on four publicly available datasets demonstrate
    the superiority of our CBox4CR over the state-of-the-art models in recommendation
    task.

  title: Contrastive Box Embedding for Collaborative Reasoning
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591654
- abstract: 'Many re-ranking strategies in search systems rely on stochastic ranking
    policies, encoded as Doubly-Stochastic (DS) matrices, that satisfy desired ranking
    constraints in expectation, e.g., Fairness of Exposure (FOE). These strategies
    are generally two-stage pipelines: (i) an offline re-ranking policy construction
    step and (ii) an online sampling of rankings step. Building a re-ranking policy
    requires repeatedly solving a constrained optimization problem, one for each issued
    query. Thus, it is necessary to recompute the optimization procedure for any new/unseen
    query. Regarding sampling, the Birkhoff-von-Neumann decomposition (BvND) is the
    favored approach to draw rankings from any DS-based policy. Nonetheless, the BvND
    is too costly to compute online. Hence, the BvND as a sampling solution is memory-consuming
    as it can grow as O(N n2) for N queries and n documents.'

  title: Learning to Re-rank with Constrained Meta-Optimal Transport
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591714
- abstract: 'Sequential recommendation aims to capture users'' dynamic interest and
    predicts the next item of users'' preference. Most sequential recommendation methods
    use a deep neural network as sequence encoder to generate user and item representations.
    Existing works mainly center upon designing a stronger sequence encoder. However,
    few attempts have been made with training an ensemble of networks as sequence
    encoders, which is more powerful than a single network because an ensemble of
    parallel networks can yield diverse prediction results and hence better accuracy.
    In this paper, we present Ensemble Modeling with contrastive Knowledge Distillation
    for sequential recommendation (EMKD). Our framework adopts multiple parallel networks
    as an ensemble of sequence encoders and recommends items based on the output distributions
    of all these networks. To facilitate knowledge transfer between parallel networks,
    we propose a novel contrastive knowledge distillation approach, which performs
    knowledge transfer from the representation level via Intra-network Contrastive
    Learning (ICL) and Cross-network Contrastive Learning (CCL), as well as Knowledge
    Distillation (KD) from the logits level via minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
    between the output distributions of the teacher network and the student network.
    To leverage contextual information, we train the primary masked item prediction
    task alongside the auxiliary attribute prediction task as a multi-task learning
    scheme. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets show that EMKD achieves
    a significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides,
    we demonstrate that our ensemble method is a generalized approach that can also
    improve the performance of other sequential recommenders. Our code is available
    at this link: https://github.com/hw-du/EMKD.'

  title: Ensemble Modeling with Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Sequential
    Recommendation
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591679
- abstract: The long-tailed problem is a long-standing challenge in Sequential Recommender
    Systems (SRS) in which the problem exists in terms of both users and items. While
    many existing studies address the long-tailed problem in SRS, they only focus
    on either the user or item perspective. However, we discover that the long-tailed
    user and item problems exist at the same time, and considering only either one
    of them leads to sub-optimal performance of the other one. In this paper, we propose
    a novel framework for SRS, called Mutual Enhancement of Long-Tailed user and item
    (MELT), that jointly alleviates the long-tailed problem in the perspectives of
    both users and items. MELT consists of bilateral branches each of which is responsible
    for long-tailed users and items, respectively, and the branches are trained to
    mutually enhance each other, which is trained effectively by a curriculum learning-based
    training. MELT is model-agnostic in that it can be seamlessly integrated with
    existing SRS models. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the benefit
    of alleviating the long-tailed problems in terms of both users and items even
    without sacrificing the performance of head users and items, which has not been
    achieved by existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, MELT is the first
    work that jointly alleviates the long-tailed user and item problems in SRS.

  title: 'MELT: Mutual Enhancement of Long-Tailed User and Item for Sequential Recommendation'
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591725
- abstract: The self-attention mechanism, which equips with a strong capability of
    modeling long-range dependencies, is one of the extensively used techniques in
    the sequential recommendation field. However, many recent studies represent that
    current self-attention based models are low-pass filters and are inadequate to
    capture high-frequency information. Furthermore, since the items in the user behaviors
    are intertwined with each other, these models are incomplete to distinguish the
    inherent periodicity obscured in the time domain. In this work, we shift the perspective
    to the frequency domain, and propose a novel Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Attention
    Network for Sequential Recommendation, namely FEARec. In this model, we firstly
    improve the original time domain self-attention in the frequency domain with a
    ramp structure to make both low-frequency and high-frequency information could
    be explicitly learned in our approach. Moreover, we additionally design a similar
    attention mechanism via auto-correlation in the frequency domain to capture the
    periodic characteristics and fuse the time and frequency level attention in a
    union model. Finally, both contrastive learning and frequency regularization are
    utilized to ensure that multiple views are aligned in both the time domain and
    frequency domain. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmark
    datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs significantly better than
    the state-of-the-art approaches.

  title: Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Attention Network for Sequential Recommendation
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591689
- abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) performances as a rising approach to address
    the challenge of sparse and noisy recommendation data. Although having achieved
    promising results, most existing CL methods only perform either hand-crafted data
    or model augmentation for generating contrastive pairs to find a proper augmentation
    operation for different datasets, which makes the model hard to generalize. Additionally,
    since insufficient input data may lead the encoder to learn collapsed embeddings,
    these CL methods expect a relatively large number of training data (e.g., large
    batch size or memory bank) to contrast. However, not all contrastive pairs are
    always informative and discriminative enough for the training processing. Therefore,
    a more general CL-based recommendation model called Meta-optimized Contrastive
    Learning for sequential Recommendation (MCLRec) is proposed in this work. By applying
    both data augmentation and learnable model augmentation operations, this work
    innovates the standard CL framework by contrasting data and model augmented views
    for adaptively capturing the informative features hidden in stochastic data augmentation.
    Moreover, MCLRec utilizes a meta-learning manner to guide the updating of the
    model augmenters, which helps to improve the quality of contrastive pairs without
    enlarging the amount of input data. Finally, a contrastive regularization term
    is considered to encourage the augmentation model to generate more informative
    augmented views and avoid too similar contrastive pairs within the meta updating.
    The experimental results on commonly used datasets validate the effectiveness
    of MCLRec.

  title: Meta-optimized Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591727
- abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to predict the subsequent items
    which may interest users via comprehensively modeling users' complex preference
    embedded in the sequence of user-item interactions. However, most of existing
    SRSs often model users' single low-level preference based on item ID information
    while ignoring the high-level preference revealed by item attribute information,
    such as item category. Furthermore, they often utilize limited sequence context
    information to predict the next item while overlooking richer inter-item semantic
    relations. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical preference
    modeling framework to substantially model the complex low- and high-level preference
    dynamics for accurate sequential recommendation. Specifically, in the framework,
    a novel dual-transformer module and a novel dual contrastive learning scheme have
    been designed to discriminatively learn users' low- and high-level preference
    and to effectively enhance both low- and high-level preference learning respectively.
    In addition, a novel semantics-enhanced context embedding module has been devised
    to generate more informative context embedding for further improving the recommendation
    performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have demonstrated
    both the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones and
    the rationality of our design.

- abstract: Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering (KI-VQA) refers to answering
    a question about an image whose answer does not lie in the image. This paper presents
    a new pipeline for KI-VQA tasks, consisting of a retriever and a reader. First,
    we introduce DEDR, a symmetric dual encoding dense retrieval framework in which
    documents and queries are encoded into a shared embedding space using uni-modal
    (textual) and multi-modal encoders. We introduce an iterative knowledge distillation
    approach that bridges the gap between the representation spaces in these two encoders.
    Extensive evaluation on two well-established KI-VQA datasets, i.e., OK-VQA and
    FVQA, suggests that DEDR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 11.6% and 30.9%
    on OK-VQA and FVQA, respectively.

  title: A Symmetric Dual Encoding Dense Retrieval Framework for Knowledge-Intensive
    Visual Question Answering
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591629
- abstract: Developing a universal model that can efficiently and effectively respond
    to a wide range of information access requests-from retrieval to recommendation
    to question answering---has been a long-lasting goal in the information retrieval
    community. This paper argues that the flexibility, efficiency, and effectiveness
    brought by the recent development in dense retrieval and approximate nearest neighbor
    search have smoothed the path towards achieving this goal. We develop a generic
    and extensible dense retrieval framework, called framework, that can handle a
    wide range of (personalized) information access requests, such as keyword search,
    query by example, and complementary item recommendation. Our proposed approach
    extends the capabilities of dense retrieval models for ad-hoc retrieval tasks
    by incorporating user-specific preferences through the development of a personalized
    attentive network. This allows for a more tailored and accurate personalized information
    access experience. Our experiments on real-world e-commerce data suggest the feasibility
    of developing universal information access models by demonstrating significant
    improvements even compared to competitive baselines specifically developed for
    each of these individual information access tasks. This work opens up a number
    of fundamental research directions for future exploration.

  title: A Personalized Dense Retrieval Framework for Unified Information Access
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591626
- abstract: Recent studies have shown that Dense Retrieval (DR) techniques can significantly
    improve the performance of first-stage retrieval in IR systems. Despite its empirical
    effectiveness, the application of DR is still limited. In contrast to statistic
    retrieval models that rely on highly efficient inverted index solutions, DR models
    build dense embeddings that are difficult to be pre-processed with most existing
    search indexing systems. To avoid the expensive cost of brute-force search, the
    Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm and corresponding indexes are widely
    applied to speed up the inference process of DR models. Unfortunately, while ANN
    can improve the efficiency of DR models, it usually comes with a significant price
    on retrieval performance.

  title: Constructing Tree-based Index for Efficient and Effective Dense Retrieval
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591651
- abstract: Neural retrievers have been shown to be effective for math-aware search.
    Their ability to cope with math symbol mismatches, to represent highly contextualized
    semantics, and to learn effective representations are critical to improving math
    information retrieval. However, the most effective retriever for math remains
    impractical as it depends on token-level dense representations for each math token,
    which leads to prohibitive storage demands, especially considering that math content
    generally consumes more tokens. In this work, we try to alleviate this efficiency
    bottleneck while boosting math information retrieval effectiveness via hybrid
    search. To this end, we propose MABOWDOR, a Math-Aware Bestof-Worlds Domain Optimized
    Retriever, which has an unsupervised structure search component, a dense retriever,
    and optionally a sparse retriever on top of a domain-adapted backbone learned
    by context-enhanced pretraining, each addressing a different need in retrieving
    heterogeneous data from math documents. Our hybrid search outperforms the previous
    state-of-the-art math IR system while eliminating efficiency bottlenecks. Our
    system is available at https://github.com/approach0/pya0.

  title: 'One Blade for One Purpose: Advancing Math Information Retrieval using Hybrid
    Search'
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591746
- abstract: Retrieval approaches that score documents based on learned dense vectors
    (i.e., dense retrieval) rather than lexical signals (i.e., conventional retrieval)
    are increasingly popular. Their ability to identify related documents that do
    not necessarily contain the same terms as those appearing in the user's query
    (thereby improving recall) is one of their key advantages. However, to actually
    achieve these gains, dense retrieval approaches typically require an exhaustive
    search over the document collection, making them considerably more expensive at
    query-time than conventional lexical approaches. Several techniques aim to reduce
    this computational overhead by approximating the results of a full dense retriever.
    Although these approaches reasonably approximate the top results, they suffer
    in terms of recall -- one of the key advantages of dense retrieval. We introduce
    'LADR' (Lexically-Accelerated Dense Retrieval), a simple-yet-effective approach
    that improves the efficiency of existing dense retrieval models without compromising
    on retrieval effectiveness. LADR uses lexical retrieval techniques to seed a dense
    retrieval exploration that uses a document proximity graph. Through extensive
    experiments, we find that LADR establishes a new dense retrieval effectiveness-efficiency
    Pareto frontier among approximate k nearest neighbor techniques. When tuned to
    take around 8ms per query in retrieval latency on our hardware, LADR consistently
    achieves both precision and recall that are on par with an exhaustive search on
    standard benchmarks. Importantly, LADR accomplishes this using only a single CPU
    -- no hardware accelerators such as GPUs -- which reduces the deployment cost
    of dense retrieval systems.

  title: Lexically-Accelerated Dense Retrieval
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591715
- abstract: Dense retrieval models use bi-encoder network architectures for learning
    query and document representations. These representations are often in the form
    of a vector representation and their similarities are often computed using the
    dot product function. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning
    framework for dense retrieval. Instead of learning a vector for each query and
    document, our framework learns a multivariate distribution and uses negative multivariate
    KL divergence to compute the similarity between distributions. For simplicity
    and efficiency reasons, we assume that the distributions are multivariate normals
    and then train large language models to produce mean and variance vectors for
    these distributions. We provide a theoretical foundation for the proposed framework
    and show that it can be seamlessly integrated into the existing approximate nearest
    neighbor algorithms to perform retrieval efficiently. We conduct an extensive
    suite of experiments on a wide range of datasets, and demonstrate significant
    improvements compared to competitive dense retrieval models.

  title: Multivariate Representation Learning for Information Retrieval
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539618.3591740
- abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL), a technology that offline learns
    a policy from logged data without the need to interact with online environments,
    has become a favorable choice in decision-making processes like interactive recommendation.
    Offline RL faces the value overestimation problem. To address it, existing methods
    employ conservatism, e.g., by constraining the learned policy to be close to behavior
    policies or punishing the rarely visited state-action pairs. However, when applying
    such offline RL to recommendation, it will cause a severe Matthew effect, i.e.,
    the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, by promoting popular items or categories
    while suppressing the less popular ones. It is a notorious issue that needs to
    be addressed in practical recommender systems.

    Recommendation

- abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) relies on exposure-based inverse
    propensity scoring (IPS), a LTR-specific adaptation of IPS to correct for position
    bias. While IPS can provide unbiased and consistent estimates, it often suffers
    from high variance. Especially when little click data is available, this variance
    can cause CLTR to learn sub-optimal ranking behavior. Consequently, existing CLTR
    methods bring significant risks with them, as naively deploying their models can
    result in very negative user experiences.
