# --- Individual disqualification prompts ---

evaluation_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers using **only the abstract and introduction** to decide if they include structured evaluation.

  Disqualify a paper **only if** it clearly lacks any form of empirical, experimental, or quantitative evaluation based on the abstract and introduction.

  A paper should be **qualified** if the abstract or introduction provides **any evidence** of structured evaluation, including:
  • Mentions of experiments, benchmarks, metrics, comparisons, or datasets.
  • Statements like:
    – “We evaluate our method on…”
    – “We conducted experiments to measure…”
    – “We use metric X to assess…”
    – “Figure X shows performance results…”

  **Important clarifications**:
  • *Do not* disqualify a paper just because the evaluation is described briefly or informally.
  • *Do disqualify* a paper if the abstract/introduction contains only conceptual discussion or proposals, with no mention of empirical validation.

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: no evaluation. Reason: <brief explanation>

related_work_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers using **only the abstract and introduction** to determine if they engage with prior research.

  Disqualify a paper **only if** the abstract and introduction contain **no evidence** of engagement with prior work.

  Disqualify if:
  • There are no academic citations or references.
  • Prior work is not mentioned, compared to, or discussed in any way.

  A paper should be **qualified** if it includes any meaningful reference to earlier research, such as:
  • Mentioning related approaches or previous findings.
  • Comparing its goals or contributions with existing work.
  • Referencing prior methods, papers, or datasets.

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: no related work. Reason: <brief explanation>

novelty_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers using **only the abstract and introduction** to assess novelty.

  Disqualify a paper **only if** there are **no signs of new contributions** in the abstract or introduction.

  Consider a paper **qualified** if the abstract or introduction claims novelty, such as:
  • Proposing a new method, model, framework, or system.
  • Applying known techniques in a novel domain.
  • Stating contributions explicitly, e.g.:
    – “We propose a new…”
    – “Our contribution is…”
    – “To the best of our knowledge…”

  **Do not** disqualify a paper based on implementation or results—it’s enough to see a **clear claim of novelty**.

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: no novelty. Reason: <brief explanation>

review_only_prompt: |
  You are reviewing academic papers using **only the abstract and introduction** to check if the paper is a survey **without new contributions**.

  Disqualify only if:
  • The title contains the word "survey" or "review",
  • AND the abstract/introduction describe the paper as primarily summarizing existing work,
  • AND no new methods, results, or tools are proposed.

  Do **not** disqualify a paper if the abstract or intro:
  • Proposes a method, dataset, framework, or tool,
  • Mentions experiments or implementation,
  • Contains novelty claims (e.g., “We propose…” or “Our contribution…”).

  Answer with:
  - Qualified. Reason: <brief explanation>
  - Disqualified: review paper. Reason: <brief explanation>
  
verification_prompt: |
  You are a senior reviewer asked to verify if prior decisions on paper acceptance were justified.

  Below is a paper and a series of past disqualification or qualification decisions.

  Please respond whether the **final decision** appears valid or not, considering all reasoning. Be brief.

  Respond only with:
  - Correct: <short comment>
  - Incorrect: <short reason>
