Continued and fast dimensional scaling of CMOS eventually will approach the fundamental limit [1]. Also, Short channel effects, high power dissipation, quantum effects are limiting the further scaling of current CMOS technology devices [2-3]. Emerging device technology can overcome the scaling limitation in the current CMOS technology [1]. Single Electron Transistor (SET) [4], Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) [5] and Resonant Tunneling Diodes (RTD) [6] are some of the "Beyond CMOS" technologies. Among these evolving nanotechnologies, Quantum-dot Cellular Automata is the most favorable technology [1]. QCA is transistorless computational paradigm which can achieve device density of 10<sup>12</sup> devices/cm<sup>2</sup> and operating speed of THz. QCA device paradigm replaces FET based logic and exploit the quantum effects of small size.`
