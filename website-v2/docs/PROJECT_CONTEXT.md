# CS Rankings Arena - Project Context

## Introduction

CS Rankings Arena is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize how academic papers in computer science are evaluated, compared, and ranked. The project aims to create a more dynamic and interactive approach to academic paper assessment, moving beyond traditional citation metrics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of research impact and quality.

## Problem Statement

The current academic paper evaluation system faces several challenges:

1. **Limited Metrics**: Traditional ranking systems often rely heavily on citation counts, which may not fully capture a paper's true impact or quality.
2. **Time Lag**: Citation-based metrics take years to accumulate, making it difficult to evaluate recent research.
3. **Lack of Context**: Simple metrics don't provide enough context about a paper's contribution to its field.
4. **Limited Interaction**: Current systems don't allow for meaningful comparison between papers or research areas.
