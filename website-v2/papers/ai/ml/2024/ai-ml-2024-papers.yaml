      STORM: Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction Model for Large-Scale Outdoor  
      Scenes
    abstract: >-
      We present STORM, a spatio-temporal reconstruction model designed for
      reconstructing dynamic outdoor scenes from sparse observations. Existing
      dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense
      observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision,
      resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel
      views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for
      dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven
      Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene
      representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a
      single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all
      frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target
      timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from
      arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM
      automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks
      using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets
      show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing
      state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and
      existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions.
      STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time
      rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving
      3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase
      four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of
      self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.

    title: Different thresholding methods on Nearest Shrunken Centroid algorithm
    abstract: >-
      This article considers the impact of different thresholding methods to the
      Nearest Shrunken Centroid algorithm, which is popularly referred as the
      Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) for high-dimensional
      classification. PAM uses soft thresholding to achieve high computational
      efficiency and high classification accuracy but in the price of retaining
      too many features. When applied to microarray human cancers, PAM selected
      2611 features on average from 10 multi-class datasets. Such a large number
      of features make it difficult to perform follow up study. One reason
      behind this problem is the soft thresholding, which is known to produce
      biased parameter estimate in regression analysis. In this article, we
      extend the PAM algorithm with two other thresholding methods, hard and
      order thresholding, and a deep search algorithm to achieve better
      thresholding parameter estimate. The modified algorithms are extensively
      tested and compared to the original one based on real data and Monte Carlo
      studies. In general, the modification not only gave better cancer status
      prediction accuracy, but also resulted in more parsimonious models with
      significantly smaller number of features.

      diffIRM: A Diffusion-Augmented Invariant Risk Minimization Framework for  
      Spatiotemporal Prediction over Graphs
    abstract: >-
      Spatiotemporal prediction over graphs (STPG) is challenging, because
      real-world data suffers from the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization
      problem, where test data follow different distributions from training
      ones. To address this issue, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has emerged
      as a promising approach for learning invariant representations across
      different environments. However, IRM and its variants are originally
      designed for Euclidean data like images, and may not generalize well to
      graph-structure data such as spatiotemporal graphs due to spatial
      correlations in graphs. To overcome the challenge posed by graph-structure
      data, the existing graph OOD methods adhere to the principles of
      invariance existence, or environment diversity. However, there is little
      research that combines both principles in the STPG problem. A combination
      of the two is crucial for efficiently distinguishing between invariant
      features and spurious ones. In this study, we fill in this research gap
      and propose a diffusion-augmented invariant risk minimization (diffIRM)
      framework that combines these two principles for the STPG problem. Our
      diffIRM contains two processes: i) data augmentation and ii) invariant
      learning. In the data augmentation process, a causal mask generator
      identifies causal features and a graph-based diffusion model acts as an
      environment augmentor to generate augmented spatiotemporal graph data. In
      the invariant learning process, an invariance penalty is designed using
      the augmented data, and then serves as a regularizer for training the
      spatiotemporal prediction model. The real-world experiment uses three
      human mobility datasets, i.e. SafeGraph, PeMS04, and PeMS08. Our proposed
      diffIRM outperforms baselines.

      MCP-Solver: Integrating Language Models with Constraint Programming  
      Systems
    abstract: >-
      The MCP Solver bridges Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic solvers
      through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source standard for AI
      system integration. Providing LLMs access to formal solving and reasoning
      capabilities addresses their key deficiency while leveraging their
      strengths. Our implementation offers interfaces for constraint programming
      (Minizinc), propositional satisfiability (PySAT), and SAT modulo Theories
      (Python Z3). The system employs an editing approach with iterated
      validation to ensure model consistency during modifications and enable
      structured refinement.

      H-Net: A Multitask Architecture for Simultaneous 3D Force Estimation and  
      Stereo Semantic Segmentation in Intracardiac Catheters
    abstract: >-
      The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the
      sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models
      can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner,
      while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these
      models for devices with limited computational resources, research has
      focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However,
      there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously
      segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the
      applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel,
      lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture.
      It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and
      concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions.
      This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed
      by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from
      different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters
      to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally,
      it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the
      catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two
      classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force
      estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all
      heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating
      state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To
      the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model
      has been proposed

      Finding the Underlying Viscoelastic Constitutive Equation via Universal  
      Differential Equations and Differentiable Physics
    abstract: >-
      This research employs Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) alongside
      differentiable physics to model viscoelastic fluids, merging conventional
      differential equations, neural networks and numerical methods to
      reconstruct missing terms in constitutive models. This study focuses on
      analyzing four viscoelastic models: Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM),
      Johnson-Segalman, Giesekus, and Exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (ePTT),
      through the use of synthetic datasets. The methodology was tested across
      different experimental conditions, including oscillatory and startup
      flows. While the UDE framework effectively predicts shear and normal
      stresses for most models, it demonstrates some limitations when applied to
      the ePTT model. The findings underscore the potential of UDEs in fluid
      mechanics while identifying critical areas for methodological improvement.
      Also, a model distillation approach was employed to extract simplified
      models from complex ones, emphasizing the versatility and robustness of
      UDEs in rheological modeling.

      Stochastic Extragradient with Flip-Flop Shuffling & Anchoring: Provable  
      Improvements
    abstract: >-
      In minimax optimization, the extragradient (EG) method has been
      extensively studied because it outperforms the gradient descent-ascent
      method in convex-concave (C-C) problems. Yet, stochastic EG (SEG) has seen
      limited success in C-C problems, especially for unconstrained cases.
      Motivated by the recent progress of shuffling-based stochastic methods, we
      investigate the convergence of shuffling-based SEG in unconstrained
      finite-sum minimax problems, in search of convergent shuffling-based SEG.
      Our analysis reveals that both random reshuffling and the recently
      proposed flip-flop shuffling alone can suffer divergence in C-C problems.
      However, with an additional simple trick called anchoring, we develop the
      SEG with flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA) method which successfully converges
      in C-C problems. We also show upper and lower bounds in the
      strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, demonstrating that SEG-FFA has a
      provably faster convergence rate compared to other shuffling-based
      methods.
